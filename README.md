WELCOME TO DNSEEK
=========================
dnseek is a reverse dns lookup made in bash. It uses the "dig" command along with it's various options to retrieve
the desired dns records.


HOW TO ENTER A TARGET
==========================
Just like my previous project sqlmap https://github.com/psycolulz/sqlmentor , you will be required to manually replace
the defaultl example domains with your desired target. The reason I do this is so that you as a user will become familiar
with reading code, as well as knowing what you would have to manually enter to perform each option.
